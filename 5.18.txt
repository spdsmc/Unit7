The given script alerts "HEY YOU" and then throws a ReferenceError indicating message is not defined. The first time alert(message) is executed is within the function shout. This alerts a local variable to the function, message, which has been assigned "HEY YOU". The second call of alert(message) occurs outside of the function shout. As message is a local variable to shout and there is no global variable message defined within the script, the second call throws the ReferenceError.
